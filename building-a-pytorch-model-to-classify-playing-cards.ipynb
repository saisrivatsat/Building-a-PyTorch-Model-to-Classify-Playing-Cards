    "# **Building a PyTorch Model to Classify Playing Cards**\n",
    "\n",
    "## **Introduction**\n",
    "\n",
    "In recent years, deep learning has revolutionized the field of computer vision, enabling machines to perform complex image recognition tasks with remarkable accuracy. One of the most popular frameworks for deep learning is **PyTorch**, known for its flexibility, simplicity, and dynamic computation capabilities. This project aims to introduce the fundamentals of PyTorch by building an image classification model that can identify playing cards from a high-quality dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "Playing card recognition serves as an excellent entry point for learning deep learning concepts, given the structured nature of the dataset and the clear visual distinctions between different classes. Through this project, we will cover key deep learning workflows, from dataset preparation to model training and evaluation, while mastering PyTorchâ€™s essential components like datasets, data loaders, models, and training loops.\n",
    "\n",
    "By the end of this project, you'll not only have a robust playing card classifier but also a solid understanding of how to build and train deep learning models using PyTorch.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## **Dataset Description**\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset used in this project is a **high-quality collection of playing card images** designed specifically for image classification tasks. Hereâ€™s an overview of the dataset's key features:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Image Format & Quality:**  \n",
    "  All images are in **JPG format** with dimensions **224 x 224 x 3** (RGB channels). The images are cropped to ensure that each card occupies **over 50%** of the frame, providing clear and consistent visuals for the model to learn from.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Dataset Size:**\n",
    "  - **Training Set:** 7,624 images.\n",
    "  - **Validation Set:** 265 images.\n",
    "  - **Test Set:** 265 images.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Class Distribution:**  \n",
    "  The dataset is organized into **53 subdirectories** within each partition (train, validation, test), representing each type of playing card (e.g., \"ace of clubs,\" \"king of hearts,\" \"joker\").\n",
    "\n",
    "- **CSV File:**  \n",
    "  The dataset includes a CSV file that maps image file paths to their corresponding labels, allowing for easy dataset loading and manipulation.\n",
