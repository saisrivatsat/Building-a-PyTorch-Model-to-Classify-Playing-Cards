# Building-a-PyTorch-Model-to-Classify-Playing-Cards

This project demonstrates how to build an image classification model using **PyTorch** to recognize 53 types of playing cards. We leverage **transfer learning** with the **EfficientNet-B0** model for high accuracy. The project walks through data preparation, model training, evaluation, and visualization.

## ðŸš€ Project Workflow

1. **Setup and Imports**  
   Import required libraries: PyTorch, torchvision, timm (for pre-trained models), and others for visualization and data handling.

2. **Data Loading and Preprocessing**  
   - Create a custom `PlayingCardDataset` class using PyTorch's `Dataset`.
   - Apply transformations (resize, normalize) using `torchvision.transforms`.
   - Load data using `DataLoader` for efficient batching.

3. **Model Building**  
   - Use the pre-trained **EfficientNet-B0** model from `timm`.
   - Replace the final layer to classify 53 card types.

4. **Training the Model**  
   - Define the **loss function** (`CrossEntropyLoss`) and **optimizer** (`Adam`).
   - Implement a training loop with forward propagation, backpropagation, and validation.

5. **Evaluation and Visualization**  
   - Evaluate model performance on the test set.
   - Visualize **loss** and **accuracy** over epochs.
   - Display sample predictions with corresponding probabilities.
